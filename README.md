Package Versions
I don't know, pretty sure it's 3.4.0 across the board

Updating SDL
Just update the submodule:
```
cd SDL
git pull
cd ..

cd SDL_ttf
git pull
```
You don't need to use a submodule, you can also copy the source in directly. This repository uses a submodule to keep its size to a minimum.
